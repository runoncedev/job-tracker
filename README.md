# Simple Job Tracker

A simple tool for tracking job applications.

## Tech stack

### TanStack DB

Used TanStack DB and TanStack Query to sync data locally with the remote database. Allows implementing Optimistic UI very easily.

### Supabase

Supabase creates a full REST API for querying your tables. It also offers authentication mechanisms that are very easy to implement.

### Tailwind CSS

Pairs very well with LLMs, it's very fast to compile and easy to understand. With some external tooling like the Prettier plugin and the IDE extension, the DX is really good.

### React

99% of my experience and a frontend engineer is with React and I really enjoy it.

### Vite

Modern bundling tooling. Great DX, everything feels super fast and snappy.
